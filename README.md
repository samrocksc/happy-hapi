# Happy Hapi

This is a project designed to give a backend developer quick access to an easily scalable API in node.js using Hapi. It also provides the user with many tools that are great for development and keeping code streamlined.

## What You Will Get:

* A Cors enabled Hapi Server
* Some test casses for referencing routes
* A routes folder with example routes
* Hapi-swagger API Documentation
* An .eslintrc that is very friendly to es6 available in Node LTS.

## TODO

-[ ] More examples
-[ ] More Code
-[ ] Update .eslintrc with more Node friendly rules
-[ ] Possible setups for Database storage in branches(redis, postgres).
